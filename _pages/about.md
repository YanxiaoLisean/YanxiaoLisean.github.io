I am a postdoctral associate in Leidos. My research interest includes electrical and mechanical property characterizations for 2D materials.

I am very fortunate to work with Professor Elisa Riedo in New York Univeristy. I was advised by Professor Chengllin Wu in Missouri Univerisity of Science and Technology.
